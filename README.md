# About Me

## General

My name is Matthew W. Miller.
I am intermittently reachable at `miller.2034@wright.edu`.
You may also attempt to contact me on Discord, where my handle is
`mechanism853`.

As of Spring 2025, I am seeking to complete a Bachelor's Degree of
Computer Engineering at
[Wright State University](https://www.wright.edu).

> At my current rate, I hope to finish this course of study _before_
> the end of the 21st century.

## Some Current And Planned Projects:

- `parmc`
  - A utility for rendering parametric equations into the unofficial
    Minecraft `.schematic` file format, as used by various 3rd party
    Minecraft utilities such as MCEdit or Schematica.
  - In progress, but not yet publicly hosted. (Tool requested by a
    friend.)
- The Hydro-Pneumatic Musical Organ
  - A hydraulically actuated pneumatic organ, inspired by the classic
    trick of blowing across the top of a bottle to produce a tone.
    This permutation of that idea would dynamically adjust the level
    of some liquid in each bottle, accomplishing the dubious goal of 
    providing a wide range of notes with only a few bottles.
    This would also theoretically make it possible to support
    microtonality, note bending, and other exciting possibilities!
  - Still in the informal ideation stage. Not primarily a computer
    science project, but could be made to support a digital interface.
